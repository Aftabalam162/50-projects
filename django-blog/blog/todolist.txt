Since it is a blog, so we have three types of visitors to our website

1. Users 2. Bloggers and 3. Admin

For admin we have the admin panel and an account with unrestricted access to DB

todo : For bloggers we have to create an account with restricted access to DB

Readers/Users don't need it since they will just read the articles

CRUD app means in the context of the blog I am creating:

1. bloggers can write articles
2. users can read those articles
3. bloggers and admin can modify/moderate those articles
4. bloggers and admin can delete those articles

tables to have in the database for these things: 

1. blogs - title, content, authorID(FK), date
2. authors - name, age, email, authorID(PK)
